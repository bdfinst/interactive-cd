#   - No database credentials needed
#   - Pure static site generation
#
# See docs/FILE-BASED-DATA.md for more information.

# Feature Flags
# Enable the Practice Adoption tracking feature
# Set to 'true' to enable by default, 'false' to disable (default)
# Can be overridden per-session with URL param: ?feature=practice-adoption
#
# IMPORTANT: After changing this value, you MUST restart the dev server
# for changes to take effect (stop with Ctrl+C and run `npm run dev` again)
#
# Default: false (recommended - enable per-session with URL param for testing)
# Set to 'true' if you want the feature enabled by default in local development
