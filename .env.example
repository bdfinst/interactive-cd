# Environment Variables
#
# This application uses file-based data (src/lib/data/cd-practices.json)
# and requires minimal configuration to run.
#
# Just run:
#   npm install
#   npm run dev
#
# For production deployment (Netlify):
#   - Set feature flags as needed
#   - No database credentials needed
#   - Pure static site generation
#
# See docs/FILE-BASED-DATA.md for more information.

# Feature Flags
# Enable the Practice Adoption tracking feature
# Set to 'true' to enable, 'false' to disable (default)
#
# IMPORTANT CHANGES (Latest):
# - URL parameters (like ?feature=practice-adoption) NO LONGER control this feature
# - Feature is ONLY controlled by this environment variable
# - This ensures consistent feature state for all users
#
# IMPORTANT: After changing this value, you MUST restart the dev server
# for changes to take effect (stop with Ctrl+C and run `npm run dev` again)
#
# Default: false (recommended for production)
# Set to 'true' if you want the feature enabled by default in local development
VITE_ENABLE_PRACTICE_ADOPTION=false

# Google Analytics Configuration
# GA4 Measurement ID for tracking (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
# Leave empty to disable analytics in development
# In production (Netlify), set this environment variable to enable tracking
# This supports subdomain tracking under the same GA property
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=
