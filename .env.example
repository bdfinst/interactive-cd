# Environment Variables
#
# ✨ No environment variables needed! ✨
#
# This application uses file-based data (src/lib/data/cd-practices.json)
# and requires zero configuration to run.
#
# Just run:
#   npm install
#   npm run dev
#
# For production deployment (Netlify):
#   - No environment variables required
#   - No database credentials needed
#   - Pure static site generation
#
# See docs/FILE-BASED-DATA.md for more information.
