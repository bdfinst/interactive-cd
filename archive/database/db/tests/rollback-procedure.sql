-- ============================================================================
-- ROLLBACK PROCEDURE AND VERIFICATION
-- Purpose: Safely rollback migrations with verification
-- Usage: Execute in case of migration failure or data issues
-- ============================================================================

-- IMPORTANT: This is a template. Adjust IDs and values based on your specific migration

-- STEP 1: CAPTURE CURRENT STATE BEFORE ROLLBACK
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Create audit table for rollback verification
CREATE TEMP TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rollback_audit (
  audit_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  audit_type TEXT,
  affected_practices TEXT[],
  affected_dependencies TEXT[],
  practice_count_before INTEGER,
  dependency_count_before INTEGER,
  practice_count_after INTEGER,
  dependency_count_after INTEGER

-- Capture pre-rollback state

   FROM practice_dependencies
   WHERE practice_id IN ('trunk-based-development', 'deterministic-tests', 'behavior-driven-development')

-- STEP 2: VERIFY WHAT WILL BE ROLLED BACK
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
