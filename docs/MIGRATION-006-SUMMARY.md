# Migration 006 Summary: Unified Team Backlog Dependency Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Migration File:** `db/data/006_add_backlog_product_goals_dependency.sql`
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Applied
**Version:** 1.3.0 → 1.3.1

---

## Executive Summary

Added the missing dependency from **unified-team-backlog** to **product-goals**. This dependency was identified as necessary because teams need clear product goals to determine what work belongs in their backlog.

---

## What Was Changed

### 1 New Dependency Added

```
unified-team-backlog → product-goals
```

**Rationale:** Without clear product goals, teams cannot effectively determine:
- What work should be in the backlog
- What work is out of scope
- How to filter feature requests
- What aligns with product strategy

Product goals provide the essential filter for backlog inclusion.

---

## Complete Dependency Structure

### Before Migration 006

```
product-goals
  └── prioritized-features
      └── unified-team-backlog
```

### After Migration 006

```
product-goals
  ├── prioritized-features
  │   └── unified-team-backlog
  └── unified-team-backlog (NEW - creates diamond dependency)
```

This creates a **diamond dependency pattern**, which is valid and represents the reality:

1. **Product Goals** → Foundation for both practices
2. **Unified Team Backlog** → Needs goals to know what's in scope
3. **Prioritized Features** → Needs both backlog AND goals to prioritize
4. **Continuous Integration** → Integrates the prioritized work

## Statistics

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Total Practices** | 52 | 52 | 0 |
| **Total Dependencies** | ~114 | ~115 | +1 |
| **Database Version** | 1.3.0 | 1.3.1 | +0.0.1 (patch) |

```

### Verification Results

✅ **Dependency Added:** unified-team-backlog → product-goals
✅ **Version Updated:** 1.3.1
✅ **No Circular Dependencies:** Verified (diamond is valid)
✅ **Idempotency:** Safe to re-run

## Why This Dependency Matters

### The Problem

Without product goals, a unified team backlog becomes:
- **Unfocused** - Everything gets added "just in case"
- **Unfiltered** - No clear criteria for inclusion
- **Unaligned** - Work doesn't support product strategy
- **Unmaintainable** - Grows without bounds

### The Solution

With product goals as a dependency:
- ✅ **Focused** - Only work aligned with goals enters backlog
- ✅ **Filtered** - Goals provide clear inclusion criteria
- ✅ **Aligned** - All backlog items support product strategy
- ✅ **Maintainable** - Work that doesn't support goals is removed

### Example

**Product Goals:**
```
Goal 1: Increase user retention by 20% in Q1
Goal 2: Reduce time-to-value for new users from 30 to 10 minutes
```

**Backlog Items (Filtered by Goals):**

✅ **IN SCOPE:**
- Onboarding tutorial → Supports Goal 2
- Email reminder system → Supports Goal 1
- User progress dashboard → Supports Goal 1

❌ **OUT OF SCOPE:**
- Dark mode → Nice-to-have, no goal alignment
- Advanced analytics → Future goal, not current
- Social media sharing → Doesn't support current goals

---

## Diamond Dependency Pattern

This migration creates a diamond dependency, which is valid:

```
         product-goals
         /           \
        /             \
unified-team-backlog  |
        \             |
         \            |
      prioritized-features
              |
    continuous-integration
```

**Why this is correct:**

1. **unified-team-backlog** needs **product-goals** to determine scope
2. **prioritized-features** needs **product-goals** to prioritize by value
3. **prioritized-features** needs **unified-team-backlog** to have items to prioritize
4. Both dependencies are necessary and don't create a cycle

---

## BDD Scenario

### Feature: Product Goal-Driven Backlog Management

```gherkin
Scenario: Backlog items are filtered by product goals
  Given the team has defined product goals:
    | Goal                          | Target              |
    | Increase user retention       | 20% improvement     |
    | Reduce onboarding time        | 30min → 10min       |
  And the team receives feature requests:
    | Feature Request      | Goal Alignment       |
    | Onboarding tutorial  | Onboarding time goal |
    | Dark mode            | No goal alignment    |
    | Email reminders      | User retention goal  |
  When the team adds items to the unified backlog
  Then the backlog should contain:
    | Backlog Item         |
    | Onboarding tutorial  |
    | Email reminders      |
  And the backlog should NOT contain:
    | Rejected Item        | Reason               |
    | Dark mode            | No goal alignment    |
```

## Validation Queries

### Check Dependency Added

```sql
SELECT
  pd.practice_id,
  p1.name as practice_name,
  pd.depends_on_id,
  p2.name as depends_on_name
FROM practice_dependencies pd
JOIN practices p1 ON pd.practice_id = p1.id
JOIN practices p2 ON pd.depends_on_id = p2.id
WHERE pd.practice_id = 'unified-team-backlog'
  AND pd.depends_on_id = 'product-goals';
```

**Expected:** 1 row showing unified-team-backlog → product-goals

### Check Complete Dependency Chain

```sql
SELECT
  pd.practice_id,
  p1.name as practice_name,
  pd.depends_on_id,
  p2.name as depends_on_name
FROM practice_dependencies pd
JOIN practices p1 ON pd.practice_id = p1.id
JOIN practices p2 ON pd.depends_on_id = p2.id
WHERE pd.practice_id IN ('unified-team-backlog', 'prioritized-features')
  OR pd.depends_on_id = 'product-goals'
ORDER BY pd.practice_id, pd.depends_on_id;
```

**Expected:** Shows complete diamond dependency structure

### Check Version Updated

```sql
SELECT value FROM metadata WHERE key = 'version';
```

**Expected:** "1.3.1"

### Verify No Cycles (Diamond is NOT a Cycle)

```sql
SELECT * FROM practices p WHERE exists(
  SELECT 1 FROM get_practice_ancestors(p.id)
  WHERE id = p.id AND level > 0
);
```

**Expected:** 0 rows (diamond dependency is acyclic)

---

## Version Bump Rationale

### Why 1.3.1 (Patch) instead of 1.4.0 (Minor)?

- **Patch (1.3.1):** Bug fix or correction to existing structure
- **Minor (1.4.0):** New feature or practice added

This is a **patch** because:
- No new practices added
- Fixes incomplete dependency modeling from migration 004
- Corrects the logical relationship that should have existed
- Doesn't add functionality, just makes existing structure complete

---

## Alignment with Project Philosophy

### BDD Principles
✅ Describes behavior (how backlog depends on goals)
✅ Focus on outcomes (focused, aligned backlog)
✅ Testable (can verify goals filter backlog)

### Functional Programming
✅ Pure dependency relationship (immutable)
✅ Clear input (goals) → function (backlog filtering) → output (focused backlog)
✅ Composable with prioritized-features

### Domain-Driven Design
✅ Models real-world relationship accurately
✅ Product goals are a foundational domain concept
✅ Backlog is aggregate dependent on goals

---

## Related Practices

### Practices That Depend on Product Goals (Now 2)
1. **prioritized-features** - Uses goals to prioritize by value
2. **unified-team-backlog** - Uses goals to filter scope (NEW)

### Practices That Depend on Unified Team Backlog
1. **prioritized-features** - Prioritizes items from backlog

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Completed)
✅ Create migration file
✅ Test migration locally
✅ Verify dependency added
✅ Document migration

### Short Term
- [ ] Update UI to show dependency graph correctly
- [ ] Add example product goals to documentation
- [ ] Create backlog filtering guide based on goals

### Medium Term
- [ ] Add practice detail pages showing dependencies
- [ ] Create interactive dependency visualization
- [ ] Add tooltips explaining diamond dependencies

---

## Conclusion

Migration 006 successfully added the missing dependency from **unified-team-backlog** to **product-goals**. This correction:

✅ Completes the logical dependency model
✅ Creates valid diamond dependency pattern
✅ Accurately reflects real-world practice relationships
✅ Maintains database integrity (no cycles)
✅ Uses patch version bump appropriately

The dependency structure now correctly models that:
1. Product goals filter what's in the backlog (scope)
2. Product goals inform how to prioritize the backlog (value)
3. Both dependencies are necessary and complementary

**Migration Status:** ✅ Complete and Verified
**Version:** 1.3.1
**Total Practices:** 52
**Total Dependencies:** ~115

🎯 Product goals now drive both backlog scope AND feature prioritization! 🎯
