# Migration 005 Summary: Product Goals Practice

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Migration File:** `db/data/005_add_product_goals.sql`
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Applied
**Version:** 1.2.0 → 1.3.0

---

## Executive Summary

Added the foundational **Product Goals** practice to the database to establish the prerequisite for effective feature prioritization. This practice recognizes that teams need clear, measurable product goals before they can effectively prioritize features by business value.

---

## What Was Added

### 1 New Practice

**product-goals** - Product Goals
- **Category:** behavior
- **Type:** practice
- **Description:** Clearly defined, measurable product goals that align team effort and provide direction for feature prioritization.

### Requirements
1. Clear product vision and mission
2. Measurable objectives and key results (OKRs)
3. Stakeholder alignment on goals
4. Regular goal review and adjustment
5. Goals communicated to entire team
6. Success metrics defined
7. Time-bound goal setting

### Benefits
1. Better feature prioritization decisions
2. Team alignment on what matters most
3. Focused effort on high-impact work
4. Clearer communication with stakeholders
5. Measurable progress tracking
6. Reduced waste on low-value features
7. Strategic product direction

---

## Dependency Changes

### New Dependency Added

```
prioritized-features → product-goals
```

**Rationale:** Before a team can effectively prioritize features by business value, they need clear product goals to inform those prioritization decisions. The goals provide the "why" that helps determine which features are most valuable.

---

## Dependency Chain

The complete dependency chain now looks like this:

```
continuous-integration
  └── prioritized-features
      ├── unified-team-backlog
      └── product-goals (NEW)
```

This creates a logical flow:
1. **Product Goals** - Define what we're trying to achieve
2. **Unified Team Backlog** - Single place to track all work
3. **Prioritized Features** - Order work by business value aligned with goals
4. **Continuous Integration** - Integrate prioritized work frequently

---

## Statistics

| Metric | Before | After | Change |

| **Total Practices** | 51 | 52 | +1 |
| **Total Dependencies** | ~113 | ~114 | +1 |
| **Database Version** | 1.2.0 | 1.3.0 | +0.1.0 |

✅ **Idempotency:** Safe to re-run

---

## Rationale

### Why Product Goals?

When reviewing the dependency chain for `prioritized-features`, it became clear that effective feature prioritization requires a foundation of clear product goals. Without knowing what you're trying to achieve as a product, it's impossible to meaningfully prioritize features by business value.

### Best Practices Alignment

This practice aligns with industry best practices:

1. **Product Management:** OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
2. **Lean:** Value Stream Mapping starts with customer value
3. **Agile:** Product vision drives backlog prioritization
4. **Continuous Delivery:** Clear goals enable fast, confident decisions

### Functional Programming Perspective

From a functional programming perspective, this practice provides:

- **Input:** Product goals and vision
- **Function:** Feature prioritization
- **Output:** Ordered backlog aligned with goals

Without the input (goals), the function (prioritization) cannot produce meaningful output.

---

## Integration with Existing Practices

### Product Goals Enables:

1. **Prioritized Features** - Goals inform which features are most valuable
2. **Unified Team Backlog** - Goals help determine what goes in the backlog
3. **Component Ownership** - Goals help determine team structure
4. **Continuous Integration** - Goals guide what gets integrated

### Product Goals Requires:

- No hard dependencies (foundational practice)
- Ideally supported by stakeholder collaboration and product management

---

## Example: Product Goals in Action

### Before Product Goals

**Problem:** Team prioritizes features by:
- Whoever shouts loudest
- Technical complexity (easier first)
- Personal preferences
- Random selection

**Result:** Misaligned effort, low business value delivery

### After Product Goals

**Example Goals:**
```
Goal 1: Increase user retention by 20% in Q1
Goal 2: Reduce time-to-value for new users from 30 to 10 minutes
Goal 3: Achieve 95% uptime SLA
```

**Feature Prioritization:**
1. ✅ Onboarding tutorial → Supports Goal 2
2. ✅ Email reminders → Supports Goal 1
3. ✅ Auto-scaling → Supports Goal 3
4. ❌ Dark mode → Nice-to-have, no goal alignment
5. ❌ Advanced analytics → Future goal

**Result:** Focused effort on high-impact features aligned with goals

---

## BDD Scenario

### Feature: Product Goal-Driven Feature Prioritization

```gherkin
Scenario: Features are prioritized based on product goals
  Given the team has defined product goals:
    | Goal                          | Target              |
    | Increase user retention       | 20% improvement     |
    | Reduce onboarding time        | 30min → 10min       |
  And the team has a backlog of features:
    | Feature              | Goal Alignment       |
    | Onboarding tutorial  | Onboarding time goal |
    | Dark mode            | No goal alignment    |
  When the team prioritizes features
  Then "Onboarding tutorial" should be prioritized higher than "Dark mode"
  And the team can justify prioritization based on goals
```

## Validation Queries

### Check Practice Added

```sql
SELECT id, name, category, type, description
FROM practices
WHERE id = 'product-goals';
```

**Expected:** 1 row with product-goals practice

### Check Dependency Added

```sql
SELECT pd.practice_id, p1.name, pd.depends_on_id, p2.name
FROM practice_dependencies pd
JOIN practices p1 ON pd.practice_id = p1.id
JOIN practices p2 ON pd.depends_on_id = p2.id
WHERE pd.practice_id = 'prioritized-features'
  AND pd.depends_on_id = 'product-goals';
```

**Expected:** 1 row showing prioritized-features → product-goals

### Check Version Updated

```sql
SELECT value
FROM metadata
WHERE key = 'version';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM practices p WHERE exists(
  SELECT 1 FROM get_practice_ancestors(p.id)
  WHERE id = p.id AND level > 0
);
```

**Expected:** 0 rows (no cycles)

✅ Testable (can verify goals exist and are used)

### Functional Programming
✅ Pure dependency relationship (immutable)
✅ Clear input/output (goals → prioritization)
✅ Composable with other practices

### Domain-Driven Design
✅ Practice is an entity in the practice catalog domain
✅ Dependencies form aggregates
✅ Behavior category captures team interaction
