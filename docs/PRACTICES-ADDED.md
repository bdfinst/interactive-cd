**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing practices aligned with BDD → ATDD → TDD workflow

**Contents** (1,732 lines):

#### Testing Strategy
- Testing pyramid (70% unit / 20% integration / 10% E2E)
- Coverage targets by layer (Domain: 95-100%, UI: 70-80%)
- Test types mapped by purpose, tools, and speed

#### Test Organization
- Directory structure standards
- File naming conventions
- Test suite organization patterns

#### Specific Testing Practices
- **Unit Testing**: Pure function tests, value object tests, AAA pattern

- **E2E Testing**: Feature-to-test mapping, Playwright best practices

#### Test Data Management
- Builder pattern (`buildPractice`, `buildPracticeWithDependencies`)
- Fixture organization
- Mock strategies (API, database)

#### Coverage and Performance
- Layer-specific coverage targets
- Performance benchmarks (unit: <10ms, E2E: <5s)
- CI integration requirements

#### Anti-Patterns
- Testing implementation details
- Fragile selectors
- Multiple unrelated assertions
- Test interdependence
- Over-mocking
- Testing framework code

#### Accessibility Testing
- Semantic HTML validation
- ARIA attribute testing
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Color contrast verification

#### CI Integration
- Complete GitHub Actions workflow
- Pre-commit hooks with lint-staged
- Coverage reporting
- Performance optimization

#### Examples
- Real code examples from the project
- Good vs. bad patterns
- Copy-paste ready templates

---

### 3. Research Documentation

#### Svelte/SvelteKit Best Practices (2024-2025)

**Research Agent Findings**:
- Component organization (co-location pattern)
- State management (Svelte 5 runes, stores, context)
- Routing and data loading (filesystem-based, load functions)
- Performance optimization (code splitting, lazy loading)
- Accessibility (compiler warnings, semantic HTML)
- SEO best practices (Open Graph, JSON-LD)
- Common anti-patterns to avoid (server-side stores!)
- Functional programming patterns

**Key Recommendations**:
- Use semantic queries (`getByRole`) over `data-testid`
- Never use stores on the server
- Implement universal reactivity for state management
- Follow co-location pattern for route-specific components
- Use Svelte 5 runes for modern state management
