## Key Dependency Chains

### Self-Healing Services Chain
```
monitoring → logging-infrastructure → monitoring-and-alerting → developer-driven-support → self-healing-services
```

### Testing Hierarchy
```
continuous-delivery → continuous-testing → [integration, performance, resilience, exploratory, usability]-testing
```

## Alignment with Project Philosophy

### BDD → ATDD → TDD

The migration follows the project's BDD approach:

**Given:** CD diagram with complete practice hierarchy
**When:** Migration adds all missing practices to database
**Then:** Application displays accurate practice catalog

### Functional Programming Principles

✅ **Immutability:** Uses `ON CONFLICT` to prevent unexpected mutations
✅ **Idempotency:** Migration is a pure function (same inputs = same outputs)
✅ **Composition:** Dependencies compose practices into hierarchy
✅ **Declarative:** SQL statements describe desired state

### Domain-Driven Design

✅ **Value Objects:** Practice IDs, categories are value objects
✅ **Entities:** Practices are entities with identity
✅ **Aggregates:** Practice tree is an aggregate
✅ **Repositories:** PostgresPracticeRepository manages practices
