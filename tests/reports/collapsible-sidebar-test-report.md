# Collapsible Sidebar Menu Test Report

## Executive Summary

**Status: ❌ IMPLEMENTATION NOT FOUND**
**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Test Suite:** `/Users/bryan/_git/interactive-cd/tests/e2e/collapsible-sidebar.spec.js`

The collapsible sidebar menu feature has **NOT been implemented**. The current application still uses the slide-out menu pattern. All tests for the new collapsible sidebar functionality are failing because the feature doesn't exist yet.

## Current Implementation Status

### What EXISTS Currently:

- **Slide-out menu** that translates off-screen on mobile (`-translate-x-full`)
- Menu is **completely hidden** on mobile by default
- Menu slides in from the left when hamburger is clicked
- Desktop shows the menu by default (always visible)
- Menu toggle button only visible on mobile (`lg:hidden`)

### What is MISSING (Requirements):

- ❌ Menu is NOT always visible (it hides completely on mobile)
- ❌ Collapsed state with icons only (64px width) does not exist
- ❌ Expanded state with icons + labels (256px width) exists but not as a toggle state
- ❌ Hamburger button doesn't toggle between collapsed/expanded states
- ❌ Content area doesn't adjust margins based on menu state
- ❌ No smooth width transitions between states

## Test Execution Summary

**Total Tests:** 28
**Passed:** 3 (11%)
**Failed:** 25 (89%)

### Test Categories

#### Desktop View (≥1024px)

- ✓ Content area has correct left margin when menu is expanded
- ✓ Menu transitions are smooth (but for translate, not width)
- ✓ Some expanded menu items show icons and labels
- ✗ Menu is not collapsible to icons-only state
- ✗ Hamburger button doesn't exist on desktop
- ✗ Content area doesn't adjust when menu state changes
- ✗ Menu cannot toggle between expanded/collapsed states

#### Mobile View (<1024px)

- ✗ Menu is NOT visible by default (requirement violation)
- ✗ Menu completely hides instead of collapsing to icons
- ✗ No collapsed state with 64px width
- ✗ Hamburger shows/hides menu instead of expand/collapse
- ✗ Content area has no margin adjustments

#### MenuItem Behavior

- ✗ No collapsed state to show icons only
- ✗ No tooltips on hover in collapsed state
- ✗ Menu items don't adapt to collapsed/expanded states

#### Content Area Behavior

- ✗ Content overlaps when menu is hidden
- ✗ No dynamic margin adjustments
- ✗ Tree view positioning not verified

#### Accessibility

- ✗ Missing ARIA attributes for collapsed/expanded states
- ✗ No screen reader announcements for state changes
- ✗ Focus management not implemented for both states

#### Responsive Behavior

- ✗ No state persistence during viewport resize
- ✗ No automatic state adjustment based on breakpoint

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Feature Not Implemented**

The entire collapsible sidebar feature is missing. The current implementation uses a completely different pattern (slide-out menu).

### 2. **Current Pattern vs. Requirements**

| Requirement               | Current Implementation    | Status |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------ |
| Menu always visible       | Hidden on mobile          | ❌     |
| Collapsed state (64px)    | Not implemented           | ❌     |
| Expanded state (256px)    | Always 256px when visible | ⚠️     |
| Hamburger toggles width   | Hamburger shows/hides     | ❌     |
| Mobile default: collapsed | Mobile default: hidden    | ❌     |
| Desktop default: expanded | Desktop default: visible  | ✓      |
| Smooth transitions        | Translate transition only | ⚠️     |
| Content margin adjusts    | Fixed margin on desktop   | ❌     |

### 3. **Code Analysis**

**Current Menu.svelte Implementation:**

```svelte
<div
  data-testid="menu-content"
  class="... -translate-x-full lg:translate-x-0 ..."
>
```

This uses **translate transform** to hide/show, not width changes for collapse/expand.

**Current MenuToggle.svelte:**

```svelte
const baseClasses = 'lg:hidden ...'
```

Hamburger is **hidden on desktop**, violating the requirement for desktop users to collapse the menu.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Replace slide-out pattern with collapsible sidebar pattern**
   - Menu should always be visible (never translate off-screen)
   - Implement width-based collapse/expand (64px ↔ 256px)

2. **Update Menu.svelte**
   - Remove translate transforms
   - Add width classes that change based on collapsed state
   - Ensure menu is always visible

3. **Update MenuItem.svelte**
   - Add logic to hide/show labels based on collapsed state
   - Center icons when collapsed
   - Add tooltips for collapsed state

4. **Update MenuToggle.svelte**
   - Make visible on all screen sizes (remove `lg:hidden`)
   - Update aria-labels for collapse/expand
   - Position within or adjacent to menu

5. **Update layout margins**
   - Make content area margins reactive to menu state
   - Use CSS classes like `ml-16` (collapsed) and `ml-64` (expanded)

6. **Implement proper state management**
   - Track collapsed/expanded state in menuStore
   - Default: collapsed on mobile, expanded on desktop
   - Persist user preference

## Test Suite Quality

The test suite (`/Users/bryan/_git/interactive-cd/tests/e2e/collapsible-sidebar.spec.js`) is comprehensive and well-structured:

✅ **Strengths:**

- Covers all requirements thoroughly
- Tests responsive behavior
- Includes accessibility testing
- Tests transitions and animations
- Verifies content area adjustments

⚠️ **Minor Issues:**

- Some selectors need refinement (e.g., "Help" text conflicts)
- Could add visual regression tests
- Performance metrics could be included

## Conclusion

The collapsible sidebar menu feature has **not been implemented**. The current application uses a fundamentally different UX pattern (slide-out menu) that doesn't meet any of the core requirements.

**Next Steps:**

1. Coder agent needs to implement the collapsible sidebar feature
2. Once implemented, re-run this test suite
3. Fix any failing tests
4. Perform manual verification
5. Update documentation

The test suite is ready and comprehensive. Once the feature is implemented according to specifications, these tests will validate proper functionality.

## Test Command

To re-run tests after implementation:

```bash
npm run test:e2e -- collapsible-sidebar
```

To run with UI for debugging:

```bash
npm run test:e2e -- collapsible-sidebar --ui
```
